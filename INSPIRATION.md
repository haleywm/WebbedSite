# Inspiration

List of websites that I like the vibes off. Sometimes with specific things I actually like about them.

- https://cyber.dabamos.de/88x31/ Button collection
- https://background-tiles.com/overview/purple.php some background tiles if I want something with a bit more texture to it in the background
- https://angs-corner.nekoweb.org/ cute website with multiple columns, also I like just looking at the nekoweb webring to see what people are doing.
- https://frequency-modulator.nekoweb.org/ I admire the bold and compact design going on here. I like that the max width is wider than whatever my scaling settings say my width is, so it's really using all the screen estate that it can.
- https://willdotjpg.gay/imagecollection/imcol Collection of stamps, which are a slightly different size to the classic buttons. It seems like 99x56 is common, but it's really not that rare for them to be 55 or 57 tall for some reason.
- https://petrapixel.neocities.org and https://entropically.neocities.org are full of personality. I like the gallery at https://petrapixel.neocities.org/about/cats, I want to do something similar for my Shesha page.
- https://wrender.neocities.org/home I really enjoy the way the comment box background stays fixed even when you scroll, looks like this uses `background-attachment: fixed;`, I gotta try that.
- https://aiston.scungled.gay/projects/homelab I like the rest of the site as well but I like the way they break down what's on their homelab, and it's a lot of different opinions from the type of tech bro who normally shares their homelab setup. I can get inspiration from this for website stuff and homelab stuff that's like a 2 in 1 special.
