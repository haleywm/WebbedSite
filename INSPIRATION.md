# Inspiration

List of websites that I like the vibes off. Sometimes with specific things I actually like about them.

- https://cyber.dabamos.de/88x31/ Button collection
- https://background-tiles.com/overview/purple.php some background tiles if I want something with a bit more texture to it in the background
- https://angs-corner.nekoweb.org/ cute website with multiple columns, also I like just looking at the nekoweb webring to see what people are doing.
- https://frequency-modulator.nekoweb.org/ I admire the bold and compact design going on here. I like that the max width is wider than whatever my scaling settings say my width is, so it's really using all the screen estate that it can.
