# My Website

A thing where I try to add 1 thing a day to a website to try to slowly make something fun and unique.

## Things I want to do:

- Make the website look better
    - Make a proper font stack based on some rules I'm sure exist about reasonable fallbacks depending on what fonts people have
    - Move the page title somewhere different, decide if I need a logo
- Figure out how to automatically choose between a light and dark theme based on browser setting
- Look at other sites and find inspiration for stuff to add to mine
- Add "Fun tools" section
    - Star Trek Episode Picker
    - WIP Election tool
- Flesh out about me when I've earned it
- Organise files better
- Try to get back into making some games
    - Make pong to find a nice easy browser friendly game engine
    - Make pong 2, with explosions, intense camera angles, and groovy sound effects
    - Maybe try to make tetris again, or my very own take on a minesweeper clone
    - See if I find creativity to do more
- A "things I like" section would be fun
    - Discuss self hosting
    - Clean up my guide to server hosting and add it
    - Rant about other things I like whenever I feel like
