# My Website

A thing where I try to add 1 thing a day to a website to try to slowly make something fun and unique.

## Things I want to do:

- Figure out how to automatically choose between a light and dark theme based on browser setting
- Look at other sites and find inspiration for stuff to add to mine
- Add more episodes to the picker
    - Doctor Who maybe, sorted by doctor
- Create a "Section shortcut" include that will allow people to jump to any specific header in the page. It can be fed by front matter data marking what headers are notable.
- Try to get back into making some games
    - Make pong to find a nice easy browser friendly game engine
    - Make pong 2, with explosions, intense camera angles, and groovy sound effects
    - Maybe try to make tetris again, or my very own take on a minesweeper clone
    - See if I find creativity to do more
- Add a "links" section with my own little 88x31 sticker, and links to some handy resources or websites that I love.

Rambles I want to make:

- Self Hosting
- Making your own NAS
- Right to repair and fixing your own stuff
- Obligatory post about how cool the indie web is and why you should make your own website
- Animal Crossing
- My experience caring for a snake
- Living with chronic illness
- Why I strongly dislike pseudoscience
- Tour through Shesha's enclosure
