Shesha is my lovely pet Stimson's Python!

Note that I am not a biologist or veterinarian while I do my best to research the information that I list here, different sources say different information, and I am ultimately a hobbyist who likes to read about this topic, not an expert. Do not take everything I say as absolute fact, and do your own research!

Fun Shesha facts:
- Born 1st December 2021.
- She is approximately 1 meter long! It's hard for me to measure her exact length as she generally doesn't stretch out straight but this is usually how long she ends up.
- Her hobbies include long naps, roaming her enclosure, staring at me all evening, and locating tight spaces.
- As a python, she is totally non venomous! She has evolved to hunt pray through constriction with her powerful muscles. Due to her small size, she doesn't pose much of a threat to anyone though! Certified not really a danger-noodle unless you are a small mouse or rat.
- Stimson's Pythons are a popular species of pet snake in Australia, as they're quite small, very docile, and can meet all of their nutritional needs with just mice and/or rats, which can be fairly easily bought frozen from farms.

**Current Shesha status:** Currently hibernating over winter in a small plastic hide, very far away from any of her heaters.
