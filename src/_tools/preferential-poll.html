title: "Preferential Poll"
description: "A tool to make polls, with full preferential voting support."
longdescription: "A tool to let people create and run polls with [Preferential Voting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instant-runoff_voting) (known as Instant-Runoff Voting outside of Australia). I was unable to find any other functional yet customizable web implementations, so I made my own. Currently very basic, but suggestions to improve it are welcome if you know how to contact me."
