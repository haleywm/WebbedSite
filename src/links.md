description: "Links to websites that I think are neat and that I've taken inspiration from"

These are some indie websites that I've looked at for inspiration, or that I otherwise think are really neat, give them a look! Seeing other people make stuff in a lot of different ways, and not worrying about making it as polished as modern corporate websites really helped inspire me to work on stuff. Plus, seeing cool websites gives you the chance to pick up on what you personally thinks does or doesn't work about how they do things, and you'll often learn a new cool CSS or Javascript trick if you see something cool and use inspect element to see how they did it!

Websites here are mostly listed in the order that I came across them.

Here's my button, if you want to link to my website - ![poggers.au](/assets/images/stickers/poggerslogo.webp)

Note: these are websites that I think are really fun or inspirational, but many of them are not necessarily very accessible, and many are likely not really designed for mobile. Where used, web stickers were presumably made by the author of the linked website.

- [ang's corner](https://angs-corner.nekoweb.org/) - This is a really cute website, and I like the multiple columns design, it's a nice way of fitting lots of additional info around your site. The author's video on making her own website [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62NJbICVWkQ) was really inspirational to me in actually getting around to making my own website.
- [![Frequency Modulator](/assets/images/stickers/frequency-modulator.webp)](https://frequency-modulator.nekoweb.org/) - I admire the bold and compact web design going on here. Shows how much you can fit on a page in a small space if you're not afraid of making a webpage that's 50% dead space.
- [![Petrapixel](/assets/images/stickers/petrapixel.webp)](https://petrapixel.neocities.org) - Has a lovely amount of personality. The image gallery of her cats specifically inspired me to add a Shesha gallery. If I ever need inspiration for something to add to my website, I can always check here for some great ideas.
- [![Entropically](/assets/images/stickers/entropically.webp)](https://entropically.neocities.org) - I love the colour scheme and creativity that is visible upon entering here, their blog is really lovely, and I would love to eventually do some similar stuff to their [Cool things I found this month](https://entropically.neocities.org/blog/cool-things-2025-02/) blog post, even if I'm certainly not finding quite that many cool things every month.
- [![Wrendering](/assets/images/stickers/wrender.webp)](https://wrender.neocities.org/) - Fun vibe, I like the comment box that has a fixed background as you scroll past.
- [![Aiston](/assets/images/stickers/aiston.webp)](https://aiston.scungled.gay/) - Nice minimalist design. I want to do something similar to his [homelab page](https://aiston.scungled.gay/projects/homelab) (and also try to implement a couple of the things he uses).
- [![Housepen](/assets/images/stickers/housepen.webp)](https://housepen.nekoweb.org/) - Full of personality.
- [![Cloverbell](/assets/images/stickers/cloverbell.webp)](https://cloverbell.neocities.org/) - I wish I could be like this, an absolutely gorgeous testament to what creative talented people can make when they're making their own space on the internet.
- [![maia.crimew.gay](/assets/images/stickers/maia.crimew.gay.webp)](https://maia.crimew.gay/) - One of the first sites that made me aware of people actually doing old school web design, interesting blog that covers leaks and other interesting things, plus fun bits of info.
- [Ponett](https://ponett.dog/) - This one isn't really an indie-website but I think it's fun and the blog posts are interesting.
