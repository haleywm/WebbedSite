Shesha is my lovely pet Stimson's Python!

Note that I am not a biologist or veterinarian while I do my best to research the information that I list here, different sources say different information, and I am ultimately a hobbyist who likes to read about this topic, not an expert. Do not take everything I say as absolute fact, and do your own research!

Fun Shesha facts:
- Born 1st December 2021.
- She is approximately 1 meter long! It's hard for me to measure her exact length as she generally doesn't stretch out straight but this is usually how long she ends up.
- Her hobbies include long naps, roaming her enclosure, staring at me all evening, and locating tight spaces.
- As a python, she is totally non venomous! She has evolved to hunt pray through constriction with her powerful muscles. Due to her small size, she doesn't pose much of a threat to anyone though! Certified not really a danger-noodle unless you are a small mouse or rat.
- Stimson's Pythons are a popular species of pet snake in Australia, as they're quite small, very docile, and can meet all of their nutritional needs with just mice and/or rats, which can be fairly easily bought frozen from farms.

![Shesha the snake sits under a small half-pipe, styled to look like a log. The semi-circle opening of the pipe faces the camera, where Shesha looks out, with some of her coils visibly resting on rocks inside the pipe, and her head rests on a rung of a tiny wooden ladder placed in front of the pipe.](/assets/gallery-images/shesha-4.webp)
![Shesha the snake peeks out at you. She is at the front of her enclosure, with the door open, and her head is poking over the edge of the opening, and looking out towards the camera, with her tongue flicking out.](/assets/gallery-images/shesha-5.webp)
