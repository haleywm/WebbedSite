Here and some tools that I've made, or that I'm currently working on. They'll become available as they're made, although maybe if I end up making something a bit too resource-intensive I might end up having to stick a password on it to keep it friends-only, but I'd like to try to keep things lightweight enough that that's not a worry.

- Random Episode Picker - <span class="red">WIP</span>
    - A tool for selecting a random episode of a TV show (provided I've added it). Will give you episode summary (unless disabled) and will let you choose specific category of episodes (either specific shows, or specific seasons of a show depending on how I feel about that show).
- Preferential Poll - <span class="red">WIP</span>
    - A tool to let people create and run polls with [Preferential Voting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instant-runoff_voting) (known as Instant-Runoff Voting outside of Australia). I was unable to find any other functional yet customizable web implementations, so I have resolved to make my own.
