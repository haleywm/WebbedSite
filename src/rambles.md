description: "My collection of rambles about various topics"

Here is where I will link my rambles with opinions on different topics. Think of them as a cross between the types of shrines that I see lots of indie web people do on their websites, and blog posts. I like the idea of shrines but don't know if I feel like doing creative enough web design on every single page to go with that, although maybe I'll change my mind down the line.

Note that I'm not great at writing stuff, and I don't have an editor and I'm probably not great at proof reading. You're welcome to submit any feedback to me if you know how to reach out, and I'll try to take it to heart ðŸ˜Š.

Rambles:

{% for ramble in site.rambles %}
- [{{ ramble.title }}]({{ ramble.url }}) - {{ ramble.description }}
{% endfor %}
