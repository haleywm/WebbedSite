title: "Rambles"
description: "My collection of rambles about various topics"

Here is where I will link my rambles with opinions on different topics. Think of them as a cross between the types of shrines that I see lots of indie web people do on their websites, and blog posts. I like the idea of shrines but don't know if I feel like doing creative enough web design on every single page to go with that, although maybe I'll change my mind down the line.

Rambles:

- TODO

Rambles I want to make:

- Self Hosting
- Making your own NAS
- Right to repair and fixing your own stuff
- Obligatory post about how cool the indie web is and why you should make your own website
- Animal Crossing
- My experience caring for a snake
- Living with chronic illness
- Why I strongly dislike pseudoscience
