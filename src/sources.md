Assets used in my website:
- Pogfish: I'm not entirely clear on the origin of this gif. It's been shared around the internet for several years, and originally comes from a cropped video of a [fish having sex](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V-9eOppBkg). This particular video isn't the earliest upload I can find on youtube, but it comes from a nature photographer so it's maybe possible that they uploaded some of their earlier work onto here, or maybe it was simply posted as a funny video as they also weren't aware of the original source. My version came from the nicest gif I could see at a glance on tenor, which I cropped to be a proper square and converted to webp.
- Background image: [https://background-tiles.com/overview/purple/1043.php](https://background-tiles.com/overview/purple/1043.php). Nice little website for some background scenery.
- TV Episodes:
    - Data was extracted from [TVMaze](https://www.tvmaze.com/) and exported as json files in the format that I preferred. They have a lovely episode guide with all the information you need about the whole show on just one page.
