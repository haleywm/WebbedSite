            <p>Welcome to my webbed site!</p>
            <p>This place is a challenge for myself where I will try to add one thing every day, even if it's very small.</p>
            <p>I'll allow myself an exception when I have a busy day, but I expect to still be able to update 5-6 times a week, if not more!</p>
            <p>Over time I want to tend to this place like my own little garden and turn it into something that really reflects who I am.</p>

    <p>If you'd like to look around, check out the sidebar! Why not learn more about me, or see what tools I've made?</p>
    <p>I'm not quite done yet but I'd also like to talk about how I made this site, and how I think people can make their own website if they want to :D.</p>
