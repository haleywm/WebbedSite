        <p>Welcome to my webbed site!</p>
        <p>Here, I hope to have some fun by slowly piecing together a website. I want to split up the workload and try to keep things manageable by trying to add 1 thing a day to the website.</p>
        <p>For now, I'm keeping things very bare-bones, but as I go I'll try to slowly make it look nicer over time ðŸ¤ .</p>
