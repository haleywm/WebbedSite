                <p>Welcome to my webbed site!</p>
                <p>Here, I hope to have some fun by slowly piecing together a website. I want to split up the workload and try to keep things manageable by trying to add 1 thing a day to the website.</p>
                <p>For now, I'm keeping things very bare-bones, but as I go I'll try to slowly make it look nicer over time ðŸ¤ .</p>

        <h3>Today's Addition(s): (29/06/2025)</h3>
        <p>Added a 404 page and configured caddy to serve it as necessary.</p>
        <p>Added the random episode picker! I had some data from a previous attempt at this, but I wanted to make things more polished, and also properly source where I got the data from. Currently it supports different star trek shows, but I should be able to add more shows quite easily now.</p>
