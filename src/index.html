            <p>Welcome to my webbed site!</p>
            <p>This place is a challenge for myself where I will try to add one thing every day, even if it's very small.</p>
            <p>I'll allow myself an exception when I have a busy day, but I expect to still be able to update 5-6 times a week, if not more!</p>
            <p>Over time I want to tend to this place like my own little garden and turn it into something that really reflects who I am.</p>

    <p>If you'd like to look around, check out the sidebar! Why not learn more about me, or see what tools I've made?</p>
    <p>I'm not quite done yet but I'd also like to talk about how I made this site, and how I think people can make their own website if they want to :D.</p>

        <h3>Today's Addition(s): (10/07/2025)</h3>
        <p>Today I've added something called "Open Graph Protocol" tags to my website, which means that now if I post a link to my website on discord or hopefully other social media sites, it'll be able to generate an embed with the page description, title, and a pog fish gif!</p>
        <p>I'm also making progress on developing the API. Data validation for creating new polls is theoretically done! Still needs a lot more work but hopefully I'll get faster once I'm familiar with the library I'm using.</p>
