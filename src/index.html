                <p>Welcome to my webbed site!</p>
                <p>Here, I hope to have some fun by slowly piecing together a website. I want to split up the workload and try to keep things manageable by trying to add 1 thing a day to the website.</p>
                <p>For now, I'm keeping things very bare-bones, but as I go I'll try to slowly make it look nicer over time ðŸ¤ .</p>

        <h3>Today's Addition(s): (26/06/2025)</h3>
        <p>Improved the styling more with a fun background image and added a fish to the side of the page. I tried using one of those proper colour scheme tools but couldn't make anything that didn't look ass, because the opposite of purple is a shade of green that I didn't like and I couldn't find anything else nice.</p>
        <p>Added a fun pog fishy to the homepage :)</p>
        <p>Made a fun secret alternate theme for the site with the help of my inaccessibility advisor, will add a button to add it later.</p>
