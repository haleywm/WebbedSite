                <p>Welcome to my webbed site!</p>
                <p>Here, I hope to have some fun by slowly piecing together a website. I want to split up the workload and try to keep things manageable by trying to add 1 thing a day to the website.</p>
                <p>For now, I'm keeping things very bare-bones, but as I go I'll try to slowly make it look nicer over time ðŸ¤ .</p>

        <h3>Today's Addition(s): (27/06/2025)</h3>
        <p>Made the logo section a constant website logo. Couldn't think of a name so made it something better.</p>
        <p>Moved the page title to the top of each page, maybe I'll theme it to be funny at some point but adding fonts to a page just for a logo feels like a cardinal sin so I'll figure out what to do on a more energetic day.</p>
