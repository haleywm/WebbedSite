Hi! I'm Haley! I'm a chronic sleepyhead from Australia. I'm not much of an artist unlike a lot of indie website people who I see around so I keep my design much simpler than a lot of places, but I try to make up for it with creativity in other places. I think that programming is a form of creativity and art on it's own.

## Fun facts:

- She/They pronounce.
- In my 20's.
- Queer.
- I have a degree in Cybersecurity but I don't really do much of that anymore.
- I have a lovely pet Stimsons Python called Shesha üêç!
- I've lived for most of my life in Australia, but I was actually born in Scotland and moved here as a young child.
- I have a hobby of home-labbing and self hosting which led to me making this website as an extension of that. I like doing things on my own hardware with my own work, so I don't have to worry about things disappearing because some company changed their plans.
- I work part time fixing up computers for a school.
- I've also been getting into learning electronics repair as a hobby! I'm avoiding anything remotely 
- I have Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (I have the energy levels of an old lady) and spend a lot of time taking things easy. Working little by little on this site lets me do creativity in my own way, in tiny chunks to not tire myself out.
